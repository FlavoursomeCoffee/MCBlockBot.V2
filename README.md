Hello there! This is a project I've been working on recently. It will display information on Minecraft blocks. Please note that this is not finished yet, as I am doing server testing and programming at the moment. At the moment, I am keeping the main code private, therefore accounting for the absence of the main file. For convienience, I have provided the invite link here.
